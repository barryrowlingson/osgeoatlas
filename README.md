Creating a cartographic atlas for OSGeo.

The purpose of this book is to show how
beautiful cartography, insightful visualisation, and stunning design
can be produced with the help of open-source tools and open data.


Submissions
===========

If you have a map or spatial data visualisation made using open-source tools
that you would like included in the atlas, please:

 * Post an image to the [flickr group](http://www.flickr.com/groups/osgeomaps/).
 * In the description, outline the software and data used in the image.
 * Make sure you have permission from any rights holders.

Images should have a width/height ratio of between square and that of
A4-size paper. Landscape or portrait orientations are acceptable, and 
may be rotated for publication.

Authors may make multiple submissions if each work is not simply a 
derivative of another. A series of related maps should be collected into
one cartographic unit.

Submissions should be substantially produced using open-source tools.
If your tool-chain involves proprietary software, we would like you 
to consider an open-source alternative. Any manipulation of the graphics
with open-source tools such as Inkscape or Gimp is fine.

Submissions using open data are especially welcome, however we can
accept anything as long as rights to release the imagery can be
obtained. This may require a copyright or source acknowledgement, and
this is the author's responsibility.

Acceptance
==========

Imagery that gets accepted into the atlas will be requested as either 
a high-resolution image or vector PDF file. The accompanying text will
be agreed between the author and the editor. Some kind of signed agreement
will be needed, as well as confirmation of rights.

The authors of the best submissions will receive a free copy and 
recognition at the FOSS4G 2013 conference.

Publishing
==========

The book will be made available by publish-on-demand from a web-based
service provider. It will ideally be approximately 50 pages, hardback
or softback, A4 size, full colour. The complete PDF will be available
for free download. The book might be in landscape mode if enough of
the submissions are in that ratio and it is supported by the printers.

Sales of the book may generate a small profit for OSGeo.

Help Required
=============

Publicity
---------

To get a large number of quality submissions we need to get the word out.
Any publicity efforts on websites, forums, mailing lists etc would be
welcome.

Selection
---------

If people want to put their name down to help judge the entries, please
email me.

Production
----------

Any help with the LaTeX would be handy too. I plan to use the
Tufte-book class.

Sponsorship
-----------

Organisations who want to fund the project should get in touch. Possible 
sponsorship offers include spots on the backcover or inside frontmatter.

Timeline

The book should be ready for the FOSS4G 2013 in Nottingham in September 
2013. A rough timeline then looks like this:
