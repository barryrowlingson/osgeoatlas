Creating a cartographic atlas for OSGeo


Submissions
===========

If you have a map or spatial data visualisation made using open-source tools
that you would like included in the atlas, please:

 * Post an image to the [flickr group](http://www.flickr.com/groups/osgeomaps/).
 * In the description, outline the software and data used in the image.
 * Make sure you have permission from any rights holders.

Images should have a width/height ratio of between square and that of
A4-size paper. Landscape or portrait orientations are acceptable, and 
may be rotated for publication.


Acceptance
==========

Imagery that gets accepted into the atlas will be requested as either 
a high-resolution image or vector PDF file. The accompanying text will
be agreed between the author and the editor. Some kind of signed agreement
will be needed, as well as confirmation of rights.


Publishing
==========

The book will be made available by publish-on-demand from a web-based
service provider. It will ideally be approximately 50 pages, hardback,
A4 size, full colour, although softback versions might be made available. The 
complete PDF will be available for free download. The book might be
in landscape mode if enough of the submissions are in that ratio.

Sales of the book may generate a small profit for OSGeo.
