This is just an illustration of a whole bunch of things.

The shading is from an SRTM digital elevation model.

The land cover raster comes from CORINE project data.

The locations of points of environmental interest comes from the Natura2000 dataset.

The nuclear processing location probably comes from some other data set.

The map was produced using Quantum GIS.

The statistical graphic was produced using R, and then everything was 
composited using Inkscape.
