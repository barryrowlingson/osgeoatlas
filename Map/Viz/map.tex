This is just to show how space-time data could be presented
as a number of frames. This is a 2x2 layout, but you could
go up to 4x6 if you can still make out the data.

I think this is crime data in police sub-regions of Cumbria, England.

Make sure all the panels line up exactly, unlike in this example.
