This map shows how the rate of Methylphenidate (Ritalin) prescription varies
greatly across the River Mersey in North-west England.

The data comes from monthly published costings and item counts of
prescription drugs for every general medical practice and clinic in 
England. This information is public open data, downloadable as a 
zipped CSV file.

Each month is loaded into a PostGIS database for retrieval. In this map,
we see point locations of medical practices coloured by spending per child.
A background grid is an interpolation computed using the R statistics system,
and significantly high regions are coloured bright red.

Maps such as these enable the exploration and investigation of disparities in
prescribing costs which may be due to underlying health reasons or changing
practices within the health service.
